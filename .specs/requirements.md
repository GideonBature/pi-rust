# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a Pi Network Rust SDK (pi-rust) that provides comprehensive functionality for server-side applications to interact with the Pi Network API. The SDK will be based on insights from the existing official Pi Network C# SDK and will be designed as an open-source project with comprehensive testing, clear documentation, and community contribution support.

The SDK will enable Rust developers to integrate Pi Network payment functionality into their applications, including payment creation, management, transaction handling, and Stellar blockchain operations.

6. WHEN fetching incomplete server payments THEN the system SHALL return a list of payments requiring server-side completion

### Requirement 3: User Authentication and Profile

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to authenticate users and retrieve their profile information, so that I can verify user identity and access permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling the me endpoint with an access token THEN the system SHALL return user authentication details
2. WHEN the access token is valid THEN the system SHALL return user profile including UID, username, and credentials
3. WHEN the access token includes scopes THEN the system SHALL return the available scopes and validity period
4. IF the access token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return appropriate authentication errors

### Requirement 4: Stellar Blockchain Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to interact with the Stellar blockchain for Pi Network transactions, so that I can handle native asset transfers and account operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN querying account balance THEN the system SHALL support Pi Network mainnet, testnet, and Stellar testnet
2. WHEN sending native assets THEN the system SHALL create and submit properly signed Stellar transactions
3. WHEN processing transactions THEN the system SHALL validate sufficient account balance before submission
4. WHEN creating transactions THEN the system SHALL support memo fields for payment identification
5. WHEN handling different networks THEN the system SHALL use appropriate server endpoints for each network type

### Requirement 5: Data Models and Serialization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strongly-typed data structures for all Pi Network entities, so that I can work with type-safe APIs and avoid runtime errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deserializing API responses THEN the system SHALL provide strongly-typed structs for all data models
2. WHEN working with payment data THEN the system SHALL include all fields (identifier, amount, status, metadata, addresses, timestamps)
3. WHEN handling user data THEN the system SHALL provide complete user profile structures with credentials and scopes
4. WHEN processing errors THEN the system SHALL provide structured error types with error names and messages
5. WHEN serializing requests THEN the system SHALL properly format data for Pi Network API consumption

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a contributor or maintainer, I want comprehensive test coverage for all functionality, so that I can ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing any public API method THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for success and failure scenarios
2. WHEN testing HTTP operations THEN the system SHALL use mock servers to simulate API responses
3. WHEN testing Stellar operations THEN the system SHALL include tests for transaction creation and signing
4. WHEN testing error handling THEN the system SHALL verify proper error propagation and formatting
5. WHEN running integration tests THEN the system SHALL test complete workflows from payment creation to completion

### Requirement 7: Open Source Project Structure

**User Story:** As an open source contributor, I want a well-organized project with clear contribution guidelines, so that I can easily understand and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include proper Cargo.toml configuration with metadata
2. WHEN documenting the project THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive README with usage examples
3. WHEN contributing THEN the system SHALL include CONTRIBUTING.md with development guidelines
4. WHEN reporting issues THEN the system SHALL provide issue templates for bugs and feature requests
5. WHEN releasing THEN the system SHALL follow semantic versioning and provide changelog documentation

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Examples

**User Story:** As a Rust developer new to Pi Network, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can quickly integrate Pi Network functionality into my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reading documentation THEN the system SHALL provide rustdoc comments for all public APIs
2. WHEN learning the SDK THEN the system SHALL include practical usage examples for common scenarios
3. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL document all possible error conditions and their meanings
4. WHEN working with different networks THEN the system SHALL provide examples for mainnet, testnet, and development usage
5. WHEN integrating THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step guides for common integration patterns

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a developer building production applications, I want robust error handling and resilience features, so that my application can gracefully handle network issues and API errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error types for different failure modes
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL expose rate limiting information
3. WHEN parsing responses fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear deserialization error messages
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL distinguish between invalid credentials and expired tokens
5. WHEN Stellar operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed transaction failure information

### Requirement 10: Performance and Async Support

**User Story:** As a developer building high-performance applications, I want efficient async operations and minimal resource usage, so that the SDK doesn't become a bottleneck in my application.

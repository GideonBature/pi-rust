# Contributing to Pi Network Rust SDK

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pi Network Rust SDK! This project is in its early development phase and we welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels.

## Project Status

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This project is currently in the specification and planning phase. No implementation has been completed yet. We are actively seeking contributors to help build this SDK from the ground up.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Version 1.70 or later
- **Git**: For version control
- **Basic knowledge of**: Rust, async programming, HTTP APIs, and blockchain concepts (helpful but not required)

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Install Rust**:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

2. **Install required tools**:
   ```bash
   rustup component add clippy rustfmt
   cargo install cargo-tarpaulin cargo-audit
   ```

3. **Fork and clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pi-rust.git
   cd pi-rust
   ```

4. **Create a new branch for your work**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Understanding the Project

Before contributing, please familiarize yourself with:

1. **[Requirements Document](.kiro/specs/pi-rust-sdk/requirements.md)** - What the SDK needs to accomplish
2. **[Design Document](.kiro/specs/pi-rust-sdk/design.md)** - How the SDK will be architected
3. **[Implementation Tasks](.kiro/specs/pi-rust-sdk/tasks.md)** - Detailed breakdown of work to be done
4. **[Pi Network C# SDK](https://github.com/pi-apps/pi-platform-docs/tree/master/SDK)** - Reference implementation

## How to Contribute

### 1. Choose a Task

Browse the [Implementation Tasks](.kiro/specs/pi-rust-sdk/tasks.md) document to find something that matches your skill level:

- **Beginner-friendly tasks**:
  - Project setup (Cargo.toml, basic structure)
  - Data model implementation (structs with serde)
  - Basic unit tests
  - Documentation improvements

- **Intermediate tasks**:
  - HTTP client implementation
  - Error handling systems
  - Authentication modules
  - Payment operations

- **Advanced tasks**:
  - Stellar blockchain integration
  - Performance optimizations
  - Complex integration tests
  - CI/CD pipeline setup

### 2. Claim Your Task

1. Check if there's already an issue for the task
2. If not, create a new issue describing what you plan to work on
3. Comment on the issue to let others know you're working on it
4. Reference the specific task from the implementation plan

### 3. Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Style

- **Follow Rust conventions**: Use `cargo fmt` to format your code
- **Use clippy**: Run `cargo clippy` and fix all warnings
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for functions and variables
- **Comments**: Add rustdoc comments for all public APIs
- **Error handling**: Use `Result<T, E>` and proper error types

#### Code Structure

Follow the planned module structure from the design document:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lib.rs              # Main library entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.rs           # Core PiNetworkClient
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.rs           # Configuration and builder
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/             # Data models module
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ payments/           # Payment operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/               # Authentication operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stellar/            # Stellar blockchain operations
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ errors.rs           # Error types and handling
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.rs            # Utility functions
```

#### Testing

- **Write tests** for all new functionality
- **Use descriptive test names** that explain what is being tested
- **Include both success and failure cases**
- **Use mock servers** for HTTP testing (wiremock crate)
- **Follow the testing patterns** shown in the task specifications

Example test structure:
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    
    #[test]
    fn test_function_name_success_case() {
        // Test implementation
    }
    
    #[test]
    fn test_function_name_error_case() {
        // Test error handling
    }
}
```

#### Documentation

- **Add rustdoc comments** for all public functions, structs, and modules
- **Include examples** in documentation when helpful
- **Update README.md** if you add new major functionality
- **Keep documentation up to date** with code changes

Example documentation:
```rust
/// Creates a new payment request
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `amount` - Payment amount in Pi
/// * `memo` - Optional memo for the payment
/// * `user_uid` - User ID from Pi Network authentication
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `Result<Payment>` - The created payment or an error
/// 
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// let payment = client.create_payment(10.0, Some("Coffee".to_string()), "user123".to_string()).await?;
/// ```
pub async fn create_payment(&self, amount: f64, memo: Option<String>, user_uid: String) -> Result<Payment> {
    // Implementation
}
```
